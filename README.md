# free4chat

[free4.chat](https://free4.chat/) is a __real-time__ audio chat service. It is designed by the [local first](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/) and `privacy first` principle, and is very easy to use.

## Features

- **Real-time Communicating**
  - [x] Voice chat in room
  - [x] Text chat in room, can sent text or emoji
    - [ ] Persist text messages to browser localStorage
  - [ ] Can send arbitrary data by WebRTC datachannel 🚩
  - [ ] Room permission setting, like public/private type setting
    - private room can't been seen on room discovery, and it needs password to enter. The password is [End-to-End Encryption](https://blog.excalidraw.com/end-to-end-encryption/), server only need check the answer which given by the client like the `PoW` in blockchain.
    - [ ] Public rooms discovery, like hot room list or filter rooms by type/tag
- **Real-time Collaborating**  
  - [ ] User real-time collaboration, like whiteboard, you draw I guess, etc.
    - [ ] Use [CRDT](https://crdt.tech/) to impelement real-time collaboration

      - https://github.com/electric-sql/vaxine
      - https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks
      - https://github.com/yjs/yjs
    - [ ] Whiteboard
      - https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw
- **Real-time Contesting**
  - [ ] AI Robot user, like game robot who can play or facilitate game
    - robot use [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API) to play with user in room
      - Azure [Text to speech](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/text-to-speech/#overview) service.
    - robot can play some voice games like language learning, technical interview, etc.
      - [Gartic Phone - The Telephone Game](https://garticphone.com/lobby)
      - [ESL Game - Not only practicing English speaking](https://esl.bmpi.dev/)
      - [Gartic.io - Draw, Guess, WIN](https://gartic.io/)
      - [Get to know someone in 17 seconds](https://github.com/caydennn/seventeen-web-app)
    - AI + Voice
      - Deep learning models are changing the world
        - [@midjourney](https://twitter.com/midjourney) can generate fatastic image from text
        - [@GitHubCopilot](https://twitter.com/GitHubCopilot) can generate context-awared code from short code segment
        - [@OpenAI](https://twitter.com/OpenAI) GPT-3 model can generate text paragraph from short sentence segment
      - Voice conversation from text?

## Architecture

- **Common**
  - [x] Use [WebSocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket) to replace http protocol of JSON-RPC
  - Compatibility
    - [ ] Make Safari(WebKit) compatibility better

- **Tech Stack**
  - [x] Use Elixir/Phoenix to rewrite the backend code
  - [x] Use Recat/Next.js to rewrite the frontend code

- **Infra**
  - [x] ~~Use docker to deploy to PaaS platform like [Railway](https://railway.app/) or [Fly](https://fly.io/)~~ 
  - [x] Use GitHub Actions + AWS Lightsail to deploy backend server
  - [x] Backend service cluster, auto scaling, load balancing, etc.
    - Backend service use Elixir libcluster to build cluster
    - Frontend app use the client load balance strategy
    - [x] [TURN cluster scale](https://github.com/membraneframework/membrane_ice_plugin/issues/20)
      - Fix by start turn before the libcluster, still wait the upstream library to fix it normally
    - [ ] Room process rebalance, that means if the node where room in is offline, then the room process can rebalance to another node, the rebalance can use [Consistent hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_hashing) to implement
      - For now, we just ignore this issue, because it can be resolved by reconnect another node and create the room again
      - Some Elixir simple approaches
        - [Swarm](https://github.com/bitwalker/swarm)
        - [Horde](https://github.com/derekkraan/horde)
      - A complex approach is use [Riak Core](https://github.com/basho/riak_core) which implement the `Consistent hashing` and can rebalance the process by [VNode](https://www.erlang-factory.com/upload/presentations/294/MasterlessDistributedComputingwithRiakCore-RKlophaus.pdf)
        - [NkDIST](https://github.com/NetComposer/nkdist), a Erlang distributed registration and load balancing lib which is base on `Riak Core`
      - [Tinode chat](https://github.com/tinode/chat) solve this issue by implementing the [Raft Consensus Algorithm](https://raft.github.io/)
